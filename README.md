# FeedMei
A clean and minimal theme for Tiny Tiny RSS, loosely inspired by Feedly. Built by making the minimal amount of changes to the default theme (which could also mean it will break soon-ish).

## Installation
Just copy all files into the `themes.local` folder of your [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org) installation.
